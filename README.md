I have created a React app to handle express API calls to a mongodb database.  I have axios and a MVP for storing an employee's first name, last name, and description.  The information is stored in a mongodb database, and can be removed.  When mongoDB documents are made, there's a delete option along with the API calls.  There's also a seperate file saving API, that passes the database and inputed file name's arguments.  It uses a node json to csv module to be able to write to a csv file, which is stored in the public folder.
